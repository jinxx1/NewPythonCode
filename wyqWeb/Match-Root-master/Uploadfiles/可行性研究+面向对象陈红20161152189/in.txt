In the real world, nobody cares that you went to an Ivy League school
A) As a high school junior, everything in my life revolved around getting into t
he right college.I diligently attended my SAT, ACT, and Advanced Placement
test preparation courses. Ijuggled (尽力应
付) cross-country and track schedules, newspaper staff, and my church's you
thgroup and drama team. I didn't drink, party, or even do much dating. The ri
ght college, Ithought, was one with prestige, one with a name. It didn't have
to be the Ivy League, but itneeded to be a "top school."
B) Looking back now, nine years later, I can't remember exactly what it was a
bout theseuniversities that made them seem so much better. Was it a curric
ulum that appeared morerigorous, perhaps? Or an alumni network that I h
oped would open doors down the line?Maybe.
"I do think there are advantages to schools with more recognition," notes M
arybethGasman, a professor of higher education at the University of Pennsylv
ania. "I don'tnecessarily think that's a reason to go to one."
C) In reflection, my firm belief in the power of the brand was naive, not to
mention a bitsnobby. I quickly passed over state schools and southern school
s, believing their curriculumsto be automatically inferior to northeastern or
western counterparts. Instead, I dreamed ofliving in New York City and my p
arents obliged me with a visit to New York University's (NYU)campus. During
the tour, tuition fees were discussed.
(NYU is consistently ranked one of thecountry's most expensive schools, wit
h room and board costs totaling upwards of $ 64,000 ayear.) Up until then, I
hadn't truly realized just how expensive an education can be. Over thenext fe
w months, I realized not only could I not afford my dream school, I couldn't e
venafford the ones where I'd been accepted. City University of New York (CU
NY), RutgersUniversity, and Indiana University were out of reach as were Miss
issippi State and theUniversity of Alabama, where I would have to pay out-ofstate
fees. Further complicating mycollege search was a flourishing track car
eer―I wanted to keep running but my timesweren't quite fast enough to sec
ure a scholarship.
D) And so, at 11 pm on the night of Georgia State University's (GSU) midnigh
t deadline, Iapplied online. Rated No.
466 overall on Forbes' Lists Top Colleges, No.
183 in ResearchUniversities, and No.
108 in the South, I can't say it was my top choice. Still, the trackcoach had
offered me a walk-on spot, and I actually found the urban Atlanta campus ad
ecent consolation prize after New York City.
E) While it may have been practical, it wasn't prestigious. But here's the thi
ng: I loved my"lower-tier" (低层次的) university.
(I use the term "low-tier" cautiously, because GSU is a well-regarded researc
h institution that attracts high quality professors and faculty from all overth
e country.) We are taught to believe that only by going to the best schools an
d getting thebest grades can we escape the rat race and build a better future
. But what if lower-tiercolleges and universities were the ticket to escaping th
e rat race? After all, where else canyou leave school with a decent degree―b
ut without a lifetime of debt?
F) My school didn't come prepackaged like the more popular options, so we
were left to takecare of ourselves, figuring out city life and trying to complete
degree programs that no onewas championing for us to succeed in. What I'm
saying is, I loved my university because ittaught us all to be resourceful and
we could make what we wanted out of it.
G) I was lucky enough to have my tuition covered by a lottery-funded schola
rship calledHOPE (Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally). When I started c
ollege, the HOPEscholarship was funded by the state of Georgia and offered t
o graduating high school seniorswith a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Living costs and
books I paid for with money earned during highschool, supplemented by a sm
all college fund my deceased grandfather left for me and amodest savings ac
count my parents created when I was born.
H) So what about all that name recognition? Sure, many of my colleagues a
nd competitorshave more glamorous alma maters (母
校) than I do. As a journalist, I have competed againstNYU, Columbia, and No
rtheastern graduates for jobs. And yet, not a single interviewer hasever asked
me about my educational background. In fact, almost every interview I've e
verhad was due to a connection―one that I've gained through pure determi
nation, not a schoolbrand.
I) According to The Boston Globe, students who earned their bachelor's in 20
12 have anaverage monthly loan payment of $312, which is one-third more
than those who graduatedin 2004. Ultimately, that's the thing universities do
n't want to admit. Private universities aremoney-making institutions. If you ca
n afford to buy prestige, that's your choice. For the restof us, however, our h
earty lower-tiered universities are just fine, thank you.
J) Wealthy universities talk up the benefits their name will give graduates: na
mely, strongalumni networks, star faculty, and a résuméboost. But you nee
dn't attend an Ivy Leagueschool to reap those rewards. Ludacris and the for
mer CEO of Bank of America Ken Lewis arealumni of my college, as well as VI
CE's first female editor-in-chief, Ellis Jones. Successfulpeople tend to be succ
essful no matter where they go to school, and lower-tier schools canhave alu
mni networks just as strong as their big name counterparts. In fact, lower-tie
r schoolalumni networks are arguably stronger, because fellow alumni recog
nize that you didn'tnecessarily have an easy path to follow. They might be m
ore willing to offer career help,because your less famous school denotes that
, like them, you are also full of energy andperseverance.
K) The Washington Post reported on a recent study by Princeton economists, i
n which collegegraduates who applied to the most selective schools in the 12
th grade were compared tothose who applied to slightly less selective schoo
ls. They found that students with morepotential earned more as adults, and
the reverse held true as well, no matter where theywent to school.
L) Likewise, star faculty are not always found where you'd expect. Big name s
chools are notnecessarily the best places for professors; plus, many professor
s split teaching time betweenmultiple colleges and/or universities. This mea
ns, for instance, a CUNY student couldreasonably expect to receive the same
quality of instruction from a prestigious professoras they would if they we
re enrolled in the same class at NYU.
M) It's possible that some hiring managers may be drawn to candidates with
a particulareducational résumé, but it's no guarantee. According to a 2012
survey described in TheAtlantic, college reputation ranked lowest in relative
importance of attributes in evaluatinggraduates for hire, beaten out by top fa
ctors like internships, employment during college,college major, volunteer ex
perience, and extracurriculars.
N) Maybe students who choose less prestigious universities are bound to suc
ceed becausethey are determined to. I tend to think so. In any case, if I co
uld do it again, I'd still makethe same choice. Today I'm debt-free, resourcef
ul―and I understand that even theshiniest packaging can't predict what yo
u'll find on the inside.
36. Modest institutions can also have successful graduates and strong alumni
networks.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by s
ome questionsor unfinished statements. For each of them there are four cho
ices marked A), B), C) andD). You should decide on the best choice and mark
the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet2 with a single line through the cen
tre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
Economically speaking, are we better off than we were ten years ago? Twenty
years ago?
In their thirst for evidence on this issue, commentators seized on the recent
report by theCensus Bureau, which found that average household income ros
e by 5.2% in 2015.Unfortunately, that conclusion puts too much weight on a
useful, but flawed andincomplete, statistic. Among the more significant pro
blems with the Census's measure arethat:
1) it excludes taxes, transfers, and compensation like employer-provided he
althinsurance; and 2) it is based on surveys rather than data. Even if precise
ly measured,income data exclude important determinants of economic wellbeing,
such as the hours ofwork needed to earn that income.
While thinking about the question, we came across a recently published articl
e by CharlesJones and Peter Klenow, which proposes an interesting new mea
sure of economic welfare.While by no means perfect, it is considerably more
comprehensive than average income,taking into account not only growth in
consumption per person but also changes in workingtime, life expectancy, an
d inequality. Moreover, it can be used to assess economicperformance bot
h across countries and over time.
The Jones-Klenow method can be illustrated by a cross-country example. Su
ppose we wantto compare the economic welfare of citizens of the U.S. and Fr
ance in 2005.
In 2005, as the authors observe: real consumption per person in France was
only 60% ashigh as the U.S., making it appear that Americans were economi
cally much better off thanthe French on average. However, that comparison
omits other relevant factors: leisuretime, life expectancy, and economic ine
quality. The French take longer vacations and retireearlier, so typically work
fewer hours; they enjoy a higher life expectancy, presumablyreflecting advant
ages with respect to health care, diet, lifestyle, and the like; and income andc
onsumption are somewhat more equally distributed there than in the U.S. Bec
ause of thesedifferences, comparing France's consumption with the U.S.'s ove
rstates the gap in economicwelfare.
Similar calculations can be used to compare the U.S. and other countries. For
example, thiscalculation puts economic welfare in the United Kingdom at 97
% of U.S. levels, butestimates Mexican well-being at 22%.
The Jones-Klenow measure can also assess an economy's performance ov
er time.According to this measure, as of the early-to-mid-2000s, the U.S. ha
d the highest economicwelfare of any large country. Since 2007, economic we
lfare in the U.S. has continued toimprove. However, the pace of improveme
nt has slowed markedly.
Methodologically, the lesson from the Jones-Klenow research is that economic
welfare ismulti-dimensional. Their approach is flexible enough that in pri
nciple other importantquality-of-life changes could be incorporated-for exa
mple, decreases in total emissions ofpollutants and declines in crime rates.
46. What does the author think of the 2015 report by the Census Bureau?
A) It is based on questionable statistics.
B) It reflects the economic changes.
C) It evidences the improved-welfare.
D) It provides much food for thought.
47. What does the author say about the Jones-Klenow method?
A) It is widely used to compare the economic growth across countries.
B) It revolutionizes the way of measuring ordinary people's livelihood.
C) It focuses on people's consumption rather than their average income.
D) It is a more comprehensive measure of people's economic well-being.
48. What do Jones and Klenow think of the comparison between France and
the U. S. interms of real consumption per person?
A) It reflected the existing big gap between the two economies.
B) It neglected many important indicators of people's welfare.
C) It covered up the differences between individual citizens.
D) It failed to count in their difference in natural resources.
49. What is an advantage of the Jones-Klenow method?
A) It can accurately pinpoint a country's current economic problems.
B) It can help to raise people's awareness of their economic well-being.
C) It can diagnose the causes of a country's slowing pace of economic impr
ovement.
D) It can compare a country's economic conditions between different periods
of time.
50) What can we infer from the passage about American people's economic
well-being?
A) It is much better than that of their European counterparts.
B) It has been on the decline ever since the turn of the century.
C) It has not improved as much as reported by the Census Bureau.
D) It has not been accurately assessed and reported since mid-2000s.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
If you've ever started a sentence with,
"If I were you..." or found yourself scratching yourhead at a colleague's agon
y over a decision when the answer is crystal-clear, there's ascientific reason
behind it. Our own decision-making abilities can become depleted over thec
ourse of the day causing indecision or poor choices, but choosing on behalf
of someone elseis an enjoyable task that doesn't suffer the same pitfalls.
The problem is "decision fatigue," a psychological phenomenon that take
s a toll on thequality of your choices after a long day of decision making, sa
ys Evan Polman, a leadingpsychologist.
Physicians who have been on the job for several hours, for example, are more
likely toprescribe antibiotics to patients when it's unwise to do so.
"Presumably it's because it'ssimple and easy to write a prescription and con
sider a patient case closed rather thaninvestigate further," Polman says.
But decision fatigue goes away when you are making the decision for som
eone else.When people imagine themselves as advisers and imagine their ow
n choices as belonging tosomeone else, they feel less tired and rely less on d
ecision shortcuts to make those choices.
"By taking upon the role of adviser rather than decision maker, one does not
suffer theconsequences of decision fatigue," he says.
"It's as if there's something fun and liberatingabout making someone else's c
hoice."
Getting input from others not only offers a fresh perspective and thought pr
ocess; it oftenalso includes riskier choices. While this sounds undesirable, it c
an be quite good, says Polman.
"When people experience decision fatigue-when they are tired of making ch
oices―theyhave a tendency to choose to go with the status quo (现
状)," he says.
"But the status quocan be problematic, since a change in the course of acti
on can sometimes be important andlead to a positive outcome."
In order to achieve a successful outcome or reward, some level of risk is al
most alwaysessential.
"People who are susceptible to decision fatigue will likely choose to do not
hingover something," he says,
"That's not to say that risk is always good, but it is related totaking action9w
hereas decision fatigue assuredly leads to inaction and the possible chagri
n(懊
恼) of a decision maker who might otherwise prefer a new course but is unfo
rtunatelyhindered."
Just because you can make good choices for others doesn't mean you'll do th
e same foryourself, Polman cautions.
"Research has found that women negotiate higher salaries forothers than the
y do for themselves," he says, adding that people slip in and out of decision
roles.
51. What does the author say about people making decisions?
A) They may become exhausted by making too many decisions for themselve
s.
B) They are more cautious in making decisions for others than for themselve
s.
C) They tend to make decisions the way they think advantageous to them.
D) They show considerable differences in their decision-making abilities.
52. What does the example about the physicians illustrate?
A) Patients seldom receive due care towards the end of the day.
B) Prescription of antibiotics can be harmful to patients' health.
C) Decision fatigue may prevent people making wise decisions.
D) Medical doctors are especially susceptible to decision fatigue.
53. When do people feel less decision fatigue?
A) When they take decision shortcuts.
B) When they help others to make decisions.
C) When they have major decisions to make.
D) When they have advisers to turn to.
54. What are people likely to do when decision fatigue sets in?
A) They turn to physicians for advice.
B) They tend to make risky decisions.
C) They adopt a totally new perspective.
D) They refrain from trying anything new.
55. What does the passage say about taking some risk in decision making?
A) It is vital for one to reach the goal desired.
B) It is likely to entail serious consequences.
C) It will enable people to be more creative.
D) It will more often than not end in regret.

Part Ⅰ Writing
The Importance of Building Trust BetweenBusinesses and Consumers
Today, in the context of this era featured by increasing commercialization an
d digitalization,mutually-trusted relations between businesses and consumers
appear to be particularlyimportant.
As for me businesses should take a leading role in establishing the trust relati
onship: to behonest with their consumers.Firstly, if a business has a dishones
t attitude toward itscustomers, the customers will lack purchasing confidenc
e in its goods or services, which willbring huge economic loss to the business.
What's worse, the adverse side effect of suchdishonesty can endanger th
e business and it is impossible to recover. The collapse ofSanlu Milk Powder
Company is a testament to this. Moreover, the incident of poisonousmilk h
as exerted devastating consequences on the whole milk powder market. Be
sides,because of the proliferation of counterfeit goods, more consumers lose
confidence indomestic products,and then they have no alternative but to
resort to foreign brands, whichis one reason why cross-border online shoppi
ng is gaining more and more popularity inChina.
Therefore, it is high time for us to strengthen the importance of maintaining
trust betweenbusinesses and consumers to promote the healthy developmen
t of the whole socialeconomy.
